Actinomarina (ultra-microbe, DOM as C source, prob smaller than SAR11)	
Alcanivorax (hydrocarbon degrader potentially, copiotroph)	
Alteromonadales (copiotroph, not sure what differentiates it from Vibrio but we did see it as very abundant in equatorial regions)	
Dadabacteria (see Elaina Graham's work, probably specializing on degrading cell membrane components according to what I recall)	
Flavobacteriales (selfish uptake, huge variability in substrates, well-studied)	
Planctomycetes (complex morphology, particle-associated)	
Rhodobacteraceae (somewhere between copio and SAR11, but huge trait variability within the group)	
SAR11 (similar to Actinomarina but not clear what differentiates them ecologically, tends to be far more abundant than Actinos)	
SAR202 (our favourite recalcitrant DOM degrader)	
SAR324 (enigmatic, may have strange C-processing pathways)	
SAR406 (enigmatic, may have strange C-processing pathways)	
SAR86 (thought to use protein and lipids, the one I mentioned previously that might be specialized on colloids)	
SUP05 (the weird fried-egg shape one, becomes very abundant in northern/southern ocean)	
Thermoplasmata (otherwise known as MGII Archaea, they seem to overlap somewhat with SAR86 in terms of metabolism, bloom-associated so maybe they can break down material a bit faster)	
Verrucomicrobia (similar in my mind to Planctomycetes, not sure what distinguishes them)	
Vibrionales
